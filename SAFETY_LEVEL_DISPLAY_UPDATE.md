# Safety Level Display Update

## Change Summary
Updated the safety level dropdown display to use Level 1-4 naming convention while keeping the backend GPI logic unchanged.

## What Changed

### Frontend Display (User-Facing)
**Label:** "Acceptable Safety Levels"

**Dropdown Options:**
1. **Level 1 - Safe Destinations**
   - Description: "Exercise normal precautions"
   - Backend value: `"Very Safe"`
   - GPI Score: < 1.6 (27 countries)

2. **Level 2 - Moderate Caution**
   - Description: "Exercise increased caution"
   - Backend value: `"Generally Safe"`
   - GPI Score: 1.6 - 2.15 (79 countries)

3. **Level 3 - High Risk**
   - Description: "Reconsider travel"
   - Backend value: `"Partly Safe"`
   - GPI Score: 2.15 - 2.7 (34 countries)

4. **Level 4 - Extreme Risk**
   - Description: "Do not travel (Adventure style only)"
   - Backend value: `"Not Safe"`
   - GPI Score: ≥ 2.7 (23 countries)

### What Stays The Same (Backend)

✅ Database query logic unchanged
- Still uses: `CountrySafetyScore.for_safety_level("Very Safe")` etc.

✅ OpenAI Service unchanged
- Still passes: `"Very Safe"`, `"Generally Safe"`, etc. to the prompt

✅ Model logic unchanged
- Still uses the same safety level scopes

✅ GPI data and thresholds unchanged
- Same 163 countries with same classifications

## How It Works

```
User sees: "Level 1 - Safe Destinations (Exercise normal precautions)"
          ↓
Form submits: safety_preference = "Very Safe"
          ↓
Backend queries: CountrySafetyScore.very_safe (GPI < 1.6)
          ↓
Returns: 27 safest countries (Iceland, Japan, Singapore, etc.)
          ↓
LLM generates: Recommendations from those 27 countries only
```

## Mapping

| Frontend Display | Backend Value | GPI Threshold | Countries |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| Level 1 - Safe Destinations | Very Safe | < 1.6 | 27 |
| Level 2 - Moderate Caution | Generally Safe | 1.6-2.15 | 79 |
| Level 3 - High Risk | Partly Safe | 2.15-2.7 | 34 |
| Level 4 - Extreme Risk | Not Safe | ≥ 2.7 | 23 |

## Benefits

1. **User-Friendly Labeling**: Level 1-4 is more intuitive than "Very Safe", "Not Safe"
2. **Clear Risk Communication**: Each level has a clear action phrase
3. **Consistent with Travel Advisories**: Mirrors standard government travel warning systems
4. **Backend Simplicity**: No changes needed to logic, queries, or data structures
